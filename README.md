# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project (MS SQL Server)

This repository contains a **Data Warehouse and Analytics system** built using **MS SQL Server**, following the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold)** with a **robust ETL pipeline** to deliver analytics-ready data.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and implement an **end-to-end data warehouse** that ingests raw data from **CRM and ERP source systems (CSV files)**, applies structured transformations, and serves clean, business-ready datasets for analytics and reporting.

The project is inspired by and structured similarly to the **Bara Data Warehouse Project**, following industry-standard data engineering practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw ingestion of CRM & ERP CSV data
- **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing, standardization, and transformation
- **Gold Layer**: Curated, analytics-ready fact and dimension tables

## 🔄 ETL Pipeline
- Automated ingestion of source CSV files  
- Data validation and transformation using SQL  
- Layered data flow aligned with Medallion architecture  
- Optimized for analytical queries and BI consumption  

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Database**: MS SQL Server  
- **ETL**: SQL-based transformations  
- **Data Sources**: CRM & ERP (CSV extracts)  
- **Modeling**: Dimensional modeling (Facts & Dimensions)

## 📈 Outcome
A scalable and maintainable **data warehouse foundation** suitable for analytics, dashboards, and business insights.
